#TRACE: Transforming Resources and Advancing Circular Economy
Developing a Digital Marketplace for Construction Material Reuse Hubs

-About the Research
Scotland faces a significant sustainability challenge: we operate at only 1.3% circularity, leaving a staggering 98.7% circularity gap. The construction industry alone accounts for nearly 50% of Scotland's material consumption, relying heavily on virgin materials rather than reused alternatives.
TRACE addresses this critical issue by developing a prototype digital marketplace for reuse hubs. Our research focuses on creating a trustworthy, real-time tracking system that connects stakeholders across the construction material reuse ecosystem. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies including blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), material passports, and QR codes, we aim to make construction material reuse more accessible, reliable, and economically viable.
The project responds to key challenges identified by industry stakeholders: limited availability of reuse hubs across Scotland and a lack of timely, trustworthy information needed to incorporate reused materials into new construction projects.
